# Lithium-Ion-battery-Kernel-PCA-
Kernel PCA is an extension of principal component analysis using techniques of kernel methods. Using a kernel, the originally linear operations of PCA are performed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.  Kernel PCA uses a kernel function to project dataset into a higher dimensional feature space, where it is linearly separable. It is similar to the idea of Support Vector Machines. The model consist of ‘2’ components followed by kernel function ‘rbf’ (radial basis function).
